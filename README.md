# shoppinglist
test with maven, spring-boot, ES6, Webpack and frontend-maven-plugin.
    
The idea is to run:
* a backend serving a proposed shopping list and endpoints to keep you own custom list.
* a web view ES6 javascript based

It is using frontend-maven-plugin:
* to install node.js and npm
* to run Webpack
* to put all your javascripts in a jar

It is using spring-boot to compile and run the backend
